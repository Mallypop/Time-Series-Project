\section{Getting started}%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First set your working directory properly, load the dataset and download and check the packages required for this tutorial. 
\subsection{Get started with the data}%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our example 1 contains the CO2 concentration (ppm) in the Atmosphere at the station Mauna Loa on Hawaii. The dataset is composed out of mean monthly data. \\
"dest" ist a text file in your destination directory, where the data should be saved. You type your directory and "/myts.txt".\\

<<results=hide>>=

\subsection{Transforming your data into a Time Series}%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can first check for data mistakes and possible errors via visualizing your data more detailed, using some diagnostic plots like the hsitogram and the QQ plot will help. 

<<label=fig1check,fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=
x <- co2
op <- par(mfrow = c(1,2),
          mar = c(5,4,1,2)+.1,
          oma = c(0,0,2,0))
hist(co2, freq=F,
     col = "cornsilk",
     xlab = "",
     main = "")
qqnorm(x,
       main = "")
qqline(x, 
       col = 'red')
par(op)
mtext("CO2 Concentration (ppm) Histogram and QQ Plot", 
      line = 2.5, 
      font = 2, 
      cex = 0.8)
@


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
<<label=fig1data.lm,fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=
data = co2month[,c(3,5)]
colnames(data)= c("year", "co2")
attach(data)
data.lm = lm( co2 ~ year)

# fit predict values
MyData=data.frame(year=seq(from=(1958),to=2014, by=0.1))
pred=predict(data.lm, newdata=MyData, type="response", se=T) #poission: type ="LINK", binomial: type="RESPONSE"

#plot the fitted values
plot(year, co2, type="n",las=1, xlab="Year", ylab="CO2 conc. (ppm)", main="CO2 concentration in the atmosphere")
grid (NULL,NULL, lty = 6, col = "cornsilk2") 
points(year, co2, col="cornflowerblue" )
#write confidence interval 
F=(pred$fit)
FSUP=(pred$fit+1.96*pred$se.fit) # make upper conf. int. 
FSLOW=(pred$fit-1.96*pred$se.fit) # make lower conf. int. 
lines(MyData$year, F, lty=1, col="red", lwd=3)
lines(MyData$year, FSUP,lty=1, col="red", lwd=3)
lines(MyData$year, FSLOW,lty=1, col="red", lwd=3)
legend("topleft",c("simple linear regression y~x", "monthly mean data"), 
       pch=c(20,20), col=c("red", "cornflowerblue"))
       
@
\end{figure}

In the plot of the data points in \ref{fig1data.lm} you can observe if you have outliers which could be biasing your model. \\
Also if you try to simply run a linear model, you see that a poly-1 linear regression will not fit (\ref{fig1data.lm}. You will get not the true evidence of p-values. The autocorrelation factor will bias your model results. The standard errors are less than  their true values thus giving high statistical significance with a p-value smaller than it should be. The clue in statistical modelling is to present the correct statistical evidence, which would in the case of a linear model highly biased. 

<<results=tex>>=
yourdata = co2month[,c(3,5)]
colnames(yourdata)= c("year", "co2")
attach(yourdata)
xtable(head(yourdata), caption="Your original data")
yourts=ts(co2, c(1958,3),c(2014,10), deltat=1/12)
class(yourts)
@
<<results=tex, echo=FALSE, print=TRUE >>=
print(xtable(yourts, digits=2, label="yourts",caption="Your time series for monthly mean data"), size="\\tiny")
@
The data stored as a dataframe needs to be transformed with the important columns into the class of a time series to continue working on it properly. If you have monthly data you have to set the deltat of the function ts() to deltat=1/12 describing the sampling period parts between successive values xt and xt+1. Your time series should somehow look like table \ref{yourts}.\\
\subsection{Data Visualization}%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is important to get a quick overview of your data. Some simple plots for visualization are quite helpful.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
<<label=fig1visualize,fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot.ts(yourts,las=1, xlab="Year", ylab="CO2 conc. (ppm)", main="CO2 concentration in the atmosphere")
grid (NULL,NULL, lty = 6, col = "cornsilk2")
points(yourts, col="cornflowerblue" )
k <- 5
lines(year,filter(co2, rep(1/k,k) ),col = 'red', type="l", lwd = 3)
legend("topleft",c("simple moving average", "monthly mean data"),
pch=c(20,20), col=c("red", "cornflowerblue"))
@
\caption{Visualization of the CO2 Concentrations}
\label{fig1visualize}
\end{figure}

The red line in plot \ref{fig1visualize} was computed with a simple moving average. It is not enough to just run a MA.\\

"As these are time series data and probably violate the independence assumption of the model, the standard error is potentially too small. As the data are regularly spaced in time, we can easily employ the autocorrelation function to investigate residuals correlations in the model errors. The acf() function can be used for that, which produces a plot of the correlogram. " ( only copy paste - noch umschreiben)
Another nice procedure is to run the autocorrelation (\ref{correlogram}) function with its complementary partial acf and the spectrum showing the spectral density of your time series at frequencies corresponding to the possibly approx. Fourier frequencies. \\ 


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
<<label=fig:correlogram,fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE>>=

op <- par(mfrow = c(3,1),
          mar = c(2,4,1,2)+.1,
          oma = c(0,0,2,0))
acf(x,      xlab = "")

pacf(x,     xlab = "")
spectrum(x, xlab = "", main = "")
par(op)
mtext("CO2 Concentration (ppm) correlogram", 
      line = 2.5, 
      font = 2, 
      cex = 0.8)

op <- par(mfrow = c(3,1),
          mar = c(2,4,1,2)+.1,
          oma = c(0,0,2,0))
acf(resid(data.lm),      xlab = "")

pacf(resid(data.lm),     xlab = "")
spectrum(resid(data.lm), xlab = "", main = "")
par(op)
mtext("Model residual correlogram", 
      line = 2.5, 
      font = 2, 
      cex = 1.2)
@
\caption{Correlogram of time series and residuals of lm}
\label{fig:correlogram}
\end{figure}

You can see in the plots of \ref{fig:correlogram} the difficulties with autocorrelation. \\
Explain the acf , pacf, spectrum here. \\
"There is a strong correlation at lag 1, a strong but weaker correlation at lag 2, and a noticeable correlation at lag 3. Such a correlation pattern is typical of an autoregressive process where most of
the sequential dependence can be explained as a  flow-on effect from a dependence at lag 1. In an autoregressive time series, an independent error component, or \innovation" is associated with each time point. For an order p autoregressive time series, the error for any time point is obtained
by taking the innovation for that time point, and adding a linear combination of the innovations at the p previous time points. (For the present time series, initial indications are that p = 1 might capture most of the correlation structure.)"\\ (autosmooth.pdf)
spectrum: easier to interpret the acf / log scaled / strong cycles where spectrum max. occurs 
Here the highest maximum is at about 0.75. 1/0.75 = 12 meaning a 12 month cycle is occuring here .


The residuals in a time series are serially correlated. The ACF is waving and decreases only slowly, which could be an identification of non-stationarity ( If the ACF would dropto zero quickly, the time series would be stationary). We stop all diagnostics here for our clearly wrong model and go on to investigate the different components of our tim series.\\

\section{Decomposition of Time Series}%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A time serie consists of 3 components; a trend component, an irregular (random) component and (if it is a seosonal time series) seasonal component.
We can decompose the ts and plot these components:

\begin{figure}
\centering
<<decompose, fig=TRUE>>=
plot(decompose(yourts)) 

@
\caption{Decomposition of the CO2 Time Series}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Decomposing Seasonal Data}%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ehm seasonal data ist ja unsere data? 

We can see each component with:
<<>>=
yourts.components<- decompose(yourts)
@
<<eval=FALSE>>=
yourts.components$seasonal
@

It seems that our seasonal component is positiv until the sommer months, were it turns to be negativ and turning to be positiv again in the winter

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
<< label=decomposition, fig=TRUE>>=
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
#we can see the trend for the first year:
ts.plot(yourts.components$seasonal[1:12])

<< label=seasonal.component, fig=TRUE>>=
ts.plot(aggregate(yourts.components$seasonal))
#and we can see that this seasonal component is constant over all the years

yourts.seasonallyadjusted <- yourts - yourts.components$seasonal
#We can then plot the seasonally adjusted time series using "plot()" 
<< label=seasonallyadjusted, fig=TRUE>>=
plot(yourts, main="TS with seasonal fl.", las=1)
<< label=notseasonallyadjusted, fig=TRUE>>=
plot(yourts.seasonallyadjusted, las=1, main="removed seasonal fluctuation")


@
\caption{The seasonal component across the time}
\label{decomposition}
\end{figure}


It seems that our data can probably be described using an additive model, since the random fluctuations in the data are roughly constant in size over time (constant seasonal component)

\subsection{Decomposing Non-Seasonal Data}%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our example 2 contains the Measurements of the annual flow of the river Nile at Ashwan 1871‚Äì1970. The dataset is in the Package {datasets}. \\
First we visualize our data:
\begin{figure}
\centering
<<>>=
str(Nile)
plot(Nile, main="Annual flow of teh Nile", ylab="Flow [V/a]")
@
\caption{Annual Flow of the Nile}
\end{figure}

A non-seasonal time series consists of a trend and an irregular component. 
To estimate the trend component of a non-seasonal time series that can be described using an additive model, it is common to use a smoothing method, such as calculating the simple moving average of the time series.

The SMA() function in the ‚ÄúTTR‚Äù R package can be used to smooth time series data using a simple moving average. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
<<fig=TRUE>>=
library(TTR)
plot(SMA(Nile,n=20))

@
\caption{Trend of the Annual Flow of the Nile}
\end{figure}
We can see that there was a negative trend until 1920 and that it becomes positiv since then. However it is difficult to make a clear statement of the trends, since there are high fluctuations in the data.


Now we can procede plotting the correlograms:
\begin{figure}
\centering
<<fig=TRUE>>=
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
acf(Nile)
pacf(Nile)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
@
\caption{Autocorrelations and Partial autocorrelations.}
\end{figure}

We find a significant autocorrelation at the first lags only, that means that the autocorrelation is not constanst over the time.
At the Partial autocorrelation plot we do not observe a significant autocorrelation. 





\sesction{Modelling the time series}
The best model for a time series needs to have residuals as white noise terms. 
There are different ways to approach this task. 


\section{Forecasts}%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have three different options to make ( up to now)
\begin{enumerate}
  \item predict
  \item Holt Winters
  \item Arima forecasts
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing}%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we have a time series that can be described using an additive model,we can short-time forecast using exponential smoothing.\\
Preconditions:forecast errors are uncorrelated and are normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance.
<<>>=
hw<-HoltWinters(yourts)
#the alpha value tells us the weight of the previous values for the forecasting
#values of alpha that are close to 0 mean that little weight is placed on the most recent observations when making forecasts of future values
#gamma is for the seasonality
plot(hw)

@
Holtwinters just makes forecasts for the time period covered by the original data.If we want to forecast for the future, we need the packeged "forecast"
\begin{figure}
\centering
<<fig=TRUE>>=
hw1<- forecast.HoltWinters(hw, h=12)
#for the next year  
plot.forecast(hw1, main="Prediction for the next year",shadecols = "oldstyle")
#for next 10 years
hw10<- forecast.HoltWinters(hw, h=120)
plot.forecast(hw10, main="Prediction for the next 10 years", shadecols = "oldstyle")
@
caption{Forecasting using Holt Winters exponential smoothing}
end{figure}

Here the forecasts for 1913-1920 are plotted as a blue line, the 80% prediction interval as an orange shaded area, and the 95% prediction interval as a yellow shaded area.

The ‚Äòforecast errors‚Äô are calculated as the observed values minus predicted values, for each time point. We can only calculate the forecast errors for the time period covered by our original time series. One measure of the accuracy of the predictive model is the sum-of-squared-errors (SSE) for the in-sample forecast errors.

To calculate a correlogram of the in-sample forecast errors for the CO2 Time series data for lags 1-20, we type:

\begin{figure}
\centering
<<>>=
acf(hw10$residuals, lag.max=20)
@
\caption{Correlogram of the residuals.}
\end{figure}


<<>>=
Box.test(hw10$residuals, lag=20, type="Ljung-Box")
@
There is little evidence of non-zero autocorrelations at lags 1-20.

<<>>=
plotForecastErrors <- function(forecasterrors)
  {
     # make a histogram of the forecast errors:
     mybinsize <- IQR(forecasterrors)/4
     mysd   <- sd(forecasterrors)
     mymin  <- min(forecasterrors) - mysd*5
     mymax  <- max(forecasterrors) + mysd*3
     # generate normally distributed data with mean 0 and standard deviation mysd
     mynorm <- rnorm(10000, mean=0, sd=mysd)
     mymin2 <- min(mynorm)
     mymax2 <- max(mynorm)
     if (mymin2 < mymin) { mymin <- mymin2 }
     if (mymax2 > mymax) { mymax <- mymax2 }
     # make a red histogram of the forecast errors, with the normally distributed data overlaid:
     mybins <- seq(mymin, mymax, mybinsize)
     hist(forecasterrors, col="red", freq=FALSE, breaks=mybins)
     # freq=FALSE ensures the area under the histogram = 1
     # generate normally distributed data with mean 0 and standard deviation mysd
     myhist <- hist(mynorm, plot=FALSE, breaks=mybins)
     # plot the normal curve as a blue line on top of the histogram of forecast errors:
     points(myhist$mids, myhist$density, type="l", col="blue", lwd=2)
  }
@


\begin{figure}
\centering
<<>>=
plotForecastErrors(hw10$residuals)
@
\caption{Histogram of the errors}
\end{figure}

The histogram of the time series shows that the forecast errors are roughly normally distributed and the mean seems to be close to zero. 


\subsecttion{Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess}
Forecasting using stl objects:
\begin{figure}
\centering
<<fig=true>>=
plot(stlf(yourts, lambda=0, h =120))
(tslm(yourts~time(yourts)))
@
\caption{}
\end{figure}

\subsection{ARIMA Models}%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the CO2 time series:
<<fig=TRUE>>=
au=auto.arima(yourts, ic = "bic")
arima1=arima(yourts, order = c(au$arma[1],au$arma[6],au$arma[2]))
fore1=forecast.Arima(arima1,h=10)
plot.forecast(fore1)

@

We can first fit an autoregression model to the Nile Time Series:
\begin{figure}
\centering
<<fig=TRUE>>=
ar(Nile) # selects order 2
cpgram(ar(Nile)$resid)
arima(Nile, c(2, 0, 0))

@
\caption{Cumulative Peridiogram of the residuals}
\end{figure}
Fitting a autoregressive model, we can see that the residuals are well placed.

Structural time series models:
\begin{figure}
\centering
<<fig=TRUE>>=
par(mfrow = c(3, 1))
plot(Nile)
## local level model
(fit <- StructTS(Nile, type = "level"))
lines(fitted(fit), lty = 2)              # contemporaneous smoothing
lines(tsSmooth(fit), lty = 2, col = 4)   # fixed-interval smoothing
plot(residuals(fit)); abline(h = 0, lty = 3)
## local trend model
(fit2 <- StructTS(Nile, type = "trend")) ## constant trend fitted
pred <- predict(fit, n.ahead = 30)
## with 50% confidence interval
ts.plot(Nile, pred$pred,
        pred$pred + 0.67*pred$se, pred$pred -0.67*pred$se, col=1:3)
